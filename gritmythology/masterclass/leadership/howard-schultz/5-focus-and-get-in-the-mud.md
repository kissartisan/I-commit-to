## Focus and Get in the Mud
- Prioritisation can't be 10 things. It should only be 3-5 things.
- Where can you have the most impact in the business?
- Where do you have something to really add that's critical to the prioritization of the organization?
- Do a personal assessment: 
  - Where was I this month?
  - Have you had the impact that you wanted to have?

## Understand the Unit Economics
- Every business has a financial models for the unit economics, cost of goods & ultimately the profitability of the business
- Sales to investment ratio 
  - Best of class is 2:1 ratio - 2x sales: 1 investment of building a store
  - If you can achieve a 20% fully loaded operating margin of that retail store, you are best of class
- You have to make sure that the hidden cost of the product is something you know a lot about -- Specifically the supply chain aspect of the business.
- Most people focus so much on the cost of the product to make it and the retail selling price and you lose sight of the cost of getting it to market.

## Keep Track of the Numbers and Get Your Hands Dirty
- Income statement is just one metric
- Another metric is health & strength of the culture and values of the company
- You need to be very visible in the early stage of it
- You should never be really suprised on what's going on because you are constantly fed by information
- Get in the mud -- get into the root of issues

## Make Key Decision With Your Partners and Customer in Mind
- Think of 2 empty chairs in your mind in a room
  - 1 Employee = Partner
  - 1 Customer
- Is this strategy will make our employee and customers proud?
