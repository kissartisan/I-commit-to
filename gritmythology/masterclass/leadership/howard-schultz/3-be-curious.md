## Be Curious
- It's vitally important to be intellectually curious
  - Constantly looking around corners
  - Putting yourself on uncomfortable situations
  - Putting yourself in a position to learn

## Learn On The Job
- First working in a company, where that company provides you with a context of understanding about: 
  - How to build an organization
  - How to work with an organization
  - What it means to be a part of the organization

## Be Curious and Ask Questions
- When and how can you put yourself in a position to ask a question or befriend somebody who can help you
- Seeking and creating personal relationships inside the org before you insert yourself is probably a good thing
- Utilise HR people to say:
  - This is where I am today.
  - This is where I want to go.
  - Who can I talk to?
  - Who can become a mentor for me?
  - What else can I do that is outside the frame of reference of my job because I have aspirations and ambitions to do all I can to contribute to the company and success
- People should understand your intentions are not for yourself, your intentions are to make a stronger and better contributions to the company
- You can't do that unless you fully understand the strategies of the company
- Do this in a way that is respectful and sincere
- Is the culture and values of the company are compatible to your own?
- Important question to ask in a company that you will be joining:
  - How does this company make decisions?
  - Decision making process of the company will teach you so much
- Don't fear about asking questions - because you are just putting yourself in a position to learn

## Find a Mentor
- People that have skills beyond your own
- Or people you feel that you can learn from them
- Asking someone to be a mentor is not a casual thing
- Find someone in a company who: 
  - You respect
  - Has an experience beyond your own
  - Can relate to you
- You should be clear on what you're asking - define the obligation
  - Can I meet with you, every other week, for an hour?
