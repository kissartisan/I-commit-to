# Find the Right Investors

## Do Your Due Diligence on Prospective Investors
- The values that you hold so dear should be applied on who your trying to convince as an investor
- What's their investment practice? Talk to the entrepreneurs and make a reference check.
- Did they share you values? Your long term approach?
- You want to know how that fund & how that person who's representing that fund has acted in the boardroom
- Setup a hyphotetical question on the investor: 
  - How are we gonna act as partners?  
  - Something goes wrong -- get a reponse on how can you rely on them during those pressure?
    - Can you give me some reference on how is this applied to your other investments/references?
- Give as much due diligence as well as them giving due diligence
- Our enthusiam has a tendency to give us permission to believe we know more than they do
  - To sometimes exaggerate the opportunity
  - Our own level of insecurity to seems overly zealous or overly confident
  - You need to balance that
- With a healthy level of skepticism & understanding about the degree of difficulty of understanding this
- Surround like-minded people with the same values and had the entrepreneurial DNA that is the same as you
- I know that I'll be a better entrepreneur with you at my side
