## Get out of the way
- In order to be effective, you need to delegate
- Don't get mired in details where you can't think big picture
- Always keep the big picture in mind

## Clarify your mission statement
- A mission statement should be: "here's our goals and here were going to achieve them"

## Be Accessible
- It's always important to set a tone of "let's work together"
- Set a tone: "I want to listen to your thoughts"
- A team can be disrupted if people don't think they've got an opportunity to visit with the team leader, and to share thoughts
- Access to "power" is incredibly important anywhere else for that matter in terms of building a team that can work together

## Share Credit, Take Blame
- When there's success, you share credit with your team. And make it abundantly clear you mean it

## Align Authority and Responsibility
- You can't hold anybody to account unless they have the authority to accomplish that which they're responsible for
