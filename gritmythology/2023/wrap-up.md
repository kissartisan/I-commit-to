### 2023
- Communication skills improved twofold
- Skills are closing up their gap
  - Had the chance to work  diversely on different projects which led to more knowledge on how to work with different envrionments
- Assets value increased and matured (cashed out some)
- Travelled like there's no tomorrow and learned from each of it
