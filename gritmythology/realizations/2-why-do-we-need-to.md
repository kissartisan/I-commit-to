Why do we need to feel something before we can be motivated to do it?

This question is maybe our natural habitat anyway but I just want to know if there's a "why" between those lines.

I just figured out that if we have a GOAL and we are motivated to do it on the present moment, we actually really FEEL it. Even though we haven't done it yet, we will most likely reach it soon or do it right away if we keep that feeling for long enough until we achieve that goal.

On the moment that you don't feel doing what you need to do, remembering why do you want to achieve it DOESN'T DO the trick I'm pretty sure.

So you need to FEEL it on especially moment that you don't want to do what you need to do. 
But that would be really HARD for sure. 
Easier said than done. That's why I'm really thinking the "how to FEEL it moment" as well.

Feeling can last for a minute, an hour, a day, a week, a month, a year or even a lifetime.

So my question is, if you have a goal, how can we keep on feeling it under any circumstances so we can strive to go for it no matter what?
