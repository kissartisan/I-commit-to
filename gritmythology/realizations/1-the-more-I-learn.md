## 01/25/21 - The more I learn...

There's a quote from Albert Einstein saying: “The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.”.
And that's what I felt after I had an interview on some network of top freelance developers.

I did came to the interview just for the sake of practicing my communication skills. But it turns out it is more eye-opening than what I expected it to be.

The interview started about myself and my past experiences and it went great until I was asked about data structures and algorithms. Yes we as developers know data structures well, but at a certain point I couldn't explain it in much details. Especially when the interviewer said what kind of algorithms I already used in my previous experiences. I stuttured continuously and my confidence goes down gradually while answering the questions since I couldn't state a specific algorithm I used even though I successfully discuss a certain problem and brought a solution to it.

After that interview I was looking down on myself and I questioned my own credibility as software developer.
I thought that learning programming principles is the core of everything that I need to learn and put into practice to become a better developer but I'm WRONG. There is a much deeper rabbit hole that I should dig into which is computer science.

So after that experience I told myself that I would dedicate an ample amount of time this year studying deeper concepts about data structures and algorithm since after that my eyes were wide-opened to the benefits of learning it after an hour or two of research.

For me it's like the programming principles are your grandparents, and the computer science is your ancestors.
And I believe that you really need to know your ancestors to become the best version of yourself.
