## Summary

- Every action you make in AWS is an API call that is authenticated and authorized. In AWS, you can make API calls to services and resources through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS software development kits (SDKs).

## Interacting with AWS
1. Via AWS Management Console
- Web-based console, where you log in and choose the desired service.
- The services are placed in categories, such as Compute, Storage, Database, and Analytics

2. Via AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
- Instead of manually logging in to the AWS Management Console and then copying and pasting information, you can schedule an AWS CLI script with an API call to pull a data for you.
- The AWS CLI is a unified tool that you can use to manage AWS services. You can download and configure one tool that you can use to control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them with scripts. 

3. Via AWS SDKs
- API calls to AWS can also be performed by running code with programming languages. 
- You can do this by using AWS software development kits (SDKs).
- SDKs are open source and maintained by AWS for the most popular programming languages, such as C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.
