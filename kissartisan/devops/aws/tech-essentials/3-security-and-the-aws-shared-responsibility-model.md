## Shared Responsibility Model

### AWS Responsibility
AWS is responsible for security **OF** the cloud. This means AWS protects and secures the infrastructure that runs the services offered in the AWS Cloud. 
AWS is responsible for:
- Protecting and securing AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and data centers, down to the physical security of the buildings
- Managing the hardware, software, and networking components that run AWS services, such as the physical servers, host operating systems, virtualization layers, and AWS networking components

### Customer Responsibility
Customers are responsible for security **IN** the cloud. When using any AWS service, youâ€™re responsible for properly configuring the service and your applications, in addition to ensuring that your data is secure.

A key concept is that customers maintain complete control of their data and are responsible for managing the security related to their content. For example, you are responsible for the following:
- Choosing a Region for AWS resources in accordance with data sovereignty regulations
- Implementing data-protection mechanisms, such as encryption and scheduled backups
- Using access control to limit who can access to your data and AWS resources
