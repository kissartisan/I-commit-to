### Uniform Distribution
- Each outcome is equally likely (e.g. rolling a 6-sided die)
- Both the mean and variance are uninterpretable
- Possess no predictive power

### Bernoulli Distribution
- E(Bernoulli event) - which outcome we expect for a single trial
- `X ~ Bern (p)`
- 1 **trial** & 2 **possible outcomes** follows a Bernoulli distribution (values are `p` & `1-p`)

### Binomial Distribution
- E(Binomial event) - The number of times we expect to get a specific outcome
- `B (n - p)`
- We can also express `Bern (p)` = `B (n, p)`

### Poisson Distribution
- Frequency with which an event occurs
- `Po(Î»)`
- No event can happen a negative amount of times so it always starts with zero (0)
- Napiers constant = 2.72
