### Uniform Distribution
- Each outcome is equally likely (e.g. rolling a 6-sided die)
- Both the mean and variance are uninterpretable
- Possess no predictive power

### Bernoulli Distribution
- X ~ Bern (p)
- E(Bernoulli event) - which outcome we expect for a single trial
- E(Binomial event) - The number of times we expect to get a specific outcome
