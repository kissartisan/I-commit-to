## Difference between imperative vs declarative programming
- “Imperative programming is like how you do something, and declarative programming is more like what you do.”

Example:
You decide that you’ve been spending too much time arguing about “JavaScript Fatigue”™ and your husband deserves a nice date. You choose to go to Red Lobster since you’ve been listening to a lot of Beyonce lately (👑🐝). You arrive at Red Lobster, approach the front desk and say…

An imperative approach (HOW): “I see that table located under the Gone Fishin’ sign is empty. My husband and I are going to walk over there and sit down.”

A declarative approach (WHAT): “Table for two, please.”

The imperative approach is concerned with HOW you’re actually going to get a seat. You need to list out the steps to be able to show HOW you’re going to get a table. The declarative approach is more concerned with WHAT you want, a table for two.
