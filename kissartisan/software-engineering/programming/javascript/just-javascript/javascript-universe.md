1. There are values, and then there’s code. We can think of values as different things “floating” in our JavaScript universe. They don’t exist inside our code, but we can refer to them from our code.
2. There are two categories of values: there are Primitive Values, and then there are Objects and Functions. In total, there are nine separate types. Each type serves a specific purpose, but some are rarely used.
3. Some values are lonely. For example, null is the only value of the Null type, and undefined is the only value of the Undefined type. As we will learn later, these two lonely values are quite the troublemakers!
4. We can ask questions with expressions. Expressions exist in our code, so they are not values. Rather, JavaScript will answer our expressions with values. For example, the 2 + 2 expression is answered with the value 4.
5. We can inspect the type of something by wrapping it in a typeof expression. For example, typeof(4) results in the string value "number".
