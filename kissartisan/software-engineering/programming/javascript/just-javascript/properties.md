## Properties

<ul><li>Properties are wires—a bit like variables. They both point to values. Unlike variables, properties <strong>start from objects</strong> in our universe.</li><li>Properties belong to particular objects. You can’t have more than one property with the same name on an object.</li><li>Generally, you can perform an assignment in three steps:<ol><li>Figure out which wire is on the left.</li><li>Figure out which value is on the right.</li><li>Point that wire to that value.</li></ol></li><li>An expression like <code>obj.property</code> is calculated in three steps:<ol><li>Figure out which value is on the left.</li><li>If it’s <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, throw an error.</li><li>If that property exists, the result is the value it points to. If that property doesn’t exist, the result is <code>undefined</code>.</li></ol></li></ul>
