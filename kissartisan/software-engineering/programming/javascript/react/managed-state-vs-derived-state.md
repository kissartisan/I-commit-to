## Difference of Managed State vs Derived State
- Managed State: State that you need to explicitly manage
- Derived State: State that you can calculate based on other state

That's really the definition for it, but it's hard to determine the use case.
It doesn't makes sense to me until I read this article: https://kentcdodds.com/blog/dont-sync-state-derive-it
