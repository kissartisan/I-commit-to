Today I when I was skimming through the free video contents of algoexpert.io, I watched the data structures crash course on logarithms.
And I was bothered by him demonstration 3 to the power of 0 is equals to 1.
I was mind blown since I'm neither a mathemathics graduate nor a computer science grad.

So I researched a bit and read the blog on the first result of search engine: http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2626

After understanding it, I can say in my own words is that raising a number to the power of 0 means that you are starting from the beginning. Which is 1.

I understand it much better when read the 4th answer about the mathematical pattern of it:

- 3**5 = 3x3x3x3x3 = 243

- 3**4 = 3x3x3x3 = 81

- 3**3 = 3x3x3 = 27

- 3**2 = 3x3 = 9

- 3**1 = 3 = 3

- 3**0 = 3/3 = 1

- 3**-1 = 1/3 = 0.3333... (this decimal repeats forever)

- 3**(-2) = 1/3/3 = 0.1111...

- 3**(-3) = 1/3/3/3 = 0.037037...
