I had the chance go to the gym for the very first time after the boom of pandemic.

Here is my rough list of the workout I did:

- 3 sets, 30 reps of dumbell push ups
- 3 sets, 30 reps of side to side leg raises with dumbbell on front as a lateral guide
- 3 sets, 10 reps of body weight sqauts
- 3 sets, 8-12 reps of lat pulldown
- 3 sets, 8-12 reps of seated cable rows
- 3 sets, 8-12 reps of face pulls
- 3 sets, 10 reps of pistol squats
- 3 sets, 8-12 reps of chest dips


Then for the finisher, I did Chris Heria's [Do This! To Get a Shredded 6 Pack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr1QiSCYSwE) for 2 rounds.
