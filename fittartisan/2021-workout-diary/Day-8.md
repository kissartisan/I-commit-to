## January 24, 2020

This day, I figured out that I need to do push-ups, sit-ups & squats until end of the year by incrementing the repetitions per day & sets per month. So on this day I did:
- 24 reps of push-ups
- 24 reps of leg raises
- 24 reps of body weight squats

The next day should be 25x25x25 of those exercises and so on.
Then the next month, it should be:
- 1st set: 31x31x31 (since January has 31 days)
- 2nd set: 1x1x1 (day 1 of February)

Seems challenging but it's really doable until end of year. :)
