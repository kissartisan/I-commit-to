This day was an abs workout day. I specifically searched for an isometric workout and here's the routine that I finished:
1. Warm up: 20 push ups
2. [Quick 7-Minute Static Hold Workout For Six Pack Abs (No Reps!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KrP-6w5G2Q)
    - I did not expected that this is not a follow-along exercise so I did less time doing this one
3. [3 Minute PLANK Workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv75ErM4wCI)
4. [DO THIS Everyday in 2021 For 6 Pack ABS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MjJRAtg-OM)
    - I did this for 2 sets
5. Cooldown: 30 push ups
